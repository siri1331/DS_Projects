Saving ML models [DecisonTree](LoanPredictionStreamLit/classifier_dt.pkl), [RandomForest](LoanPredictionStreamLit/classifier_rf.pkl) and [LogisticRegression] (LoanPredictionStreamLit/classifier.pkl)using Pickle module.
Using Streamlit as frondend to enter Loan Applicant details and predict whether to approve loan or reject based on saved model.

## To predict using [Random forests classifier](LoanPredictionStreamLit/RandomForests.py)
Streamlit run Randomforests.py

## To predict using [Decision tree classifier](LoanPredictionStreamLit/Decision_tree.py)
Streamlit run Decision_tree

## To predict using [Logistic Regression classifier](LoanPredictionStreamLit/Logistic_model.py)
Stremlit run Logistic_model
